Description:
    For this website I began with general organization. I updated index.html's divs to semantic elements and added appropriate comments making the code much easier to navigate. I did keep a couple div elements where appropriate, as there were multiple sections within the Main and Benefits Sections. 

    I then re-worked and re-ordered style.css to match those semantic elements/comments. I consolidated the style elements where appropriate to simplify the code. 

    Referring to the webpages functionality, I was able to fix the navigation link for "Search Engine Optimization" by adding a missing id. To upgrade the page to todays accessability standards, I added alt elements with basic descriptions where necessary. Lastly I added a consice, descriptive title to the webpage.
